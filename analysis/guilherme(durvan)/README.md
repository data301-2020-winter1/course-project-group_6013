The product of task 3 can be found in the (scripts folder as a py file)[scripts/project_functions.py]  

task 4 was done in [milestone2.ipynb](milestone2.ipynb), and I built upon it in the same file making plots, some of which I then improved and used in [task 5](../M2task5submission.md).  

plot images can be found in the [images folder](../../images/).  
Here's an example of one of the images made just so you can see I can embed:  
[Figure x](../../images/LPVcs.png)
