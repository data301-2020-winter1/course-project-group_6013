***Group 6013 Code of Conduct

Theis workspace is a respectful and inclusive place, where we try our best to collaborate and have fun in the project whilst putting in effort.

Harrassment and disrespect will be dealt with through communication amongst team members and conflict-resolution. 
For serious offenses/harrassment in any form (written,spoken, etc) will be communicated to the TA/Professor/Campus resources according to the seriousness.

We will strive to make this project an enjoyable learning experience.
